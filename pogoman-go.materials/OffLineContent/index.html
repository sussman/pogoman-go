<h1>Pogoman GO! Contents</h1>
<p>We have put together a bit of documentation to accompany release of the game. We have been able to package up some of it, which you can view as webpages here. However, some of the features such as the feedback forms can only be accessed online at the game website, <a href="pogomango.templaro.com">pogomango.templaro.com</a>. That's Pogoman Go, not a new type of mango, although we have nothing against mangoes. At the time of release, we are hoping to keep that site going for at least a few years, but who knows. If the site goes down, at least you've got this.</p>
