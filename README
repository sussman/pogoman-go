What is this?
-------------

This is the source code to "Pogoman Go!", an interactive fiction game
(or more commonly known as "text adventure".)  It was originally
written by Jack Welch and Ben Collins-Sussman during the summer of
2016.

The code is released under the "Creative Commons Attribution -
Noncommercial - Share Alike 3.0" license, which you can find in the
LICENSE file.

The game is written in the Inform 7 programming language, using
version 6M62.  You can download the compiler and IDE as a single
package from http://www.inform7.com

When compiled, the source code produces a bytecode file which can be
executed on any implementation of a Glulx virtual machine:

The game's source code lives in a single file called 'story.ni' --
this file, some .i7x extensions, along with the 'uuid.txt', are the
primary things kept under version control.


To build the game:
------------------

1. Create a working Inform project from your source tree:

  $ git clone URL pogoman-go
  $ cd pogoman-go
  $ mv pogoman-go.inform/ temp.inform/

  [...launch Inform, create new project in this dir called 'pogoman-go'â€¦]

  $ cp temp.inform/Source/story.ni pogoman-go.inform/Source/
  $ cp temp.inform/uuid.txt pogoman-go.inform/
  $ rm -rf temp.inform/


2. Install extensions. To keep all parts of the project together and
since we have made some edits to some extensions, extensions used in
the project are under the pogoman-go.materials/Extensions/ directory.
If the entire project is cloned, these files will come along for the
ride. Inform will look there first while compiling.

3. Launch the Inform IDE and load the pogoman-go.inform project.  The
source code should be visible, and it should compile fine.  [Make sure
that Inform's settings are are set to "Glulx" as the target VM.]


WARNING!!
  ********************************************************************
  ** DO NOT do any version control operations (commit, push,
  ** and particularly, pull, update, and merge) while the Inform IDE 
  ** is still open.  When the IDE 'saves', it destroys and recreates 
  ** the whole pogoman-go.inform/ directory, thus possibly eradicating
  ** and changes you may have downloaded.
